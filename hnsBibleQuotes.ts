And then add up the lifetime value of all the property on the earth... And compare. Then add whatever factor you think being virtual adds to the total “space” available, as it doesn’t have 3D limits. I don’t want to live on Mars. I want my feet on the Earth. And my head in the ether... Once the money is in “space”... the attention follows. Then our minds go there... to expand and evolve.
